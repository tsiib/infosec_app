DNSEnum - Attempts Zone Transfer.
------------------------

Smartmatch is experimental at /usr/bin/dnsenum line 698.
Smartmatch is experimental at /usr/bin/dnsenum line 698.
Unknown option: iclan
dnsenum VERSION:1.2.4
Usage: dnsenum [Options] <domain> 
[Options]:
Note: the brute force -f switch is obligatory.
GENERAL OPTIONS:
  --dnsserver 	<server>
			Use this DNS server for A, NS and MX queries.
  --enum		Shortcut option equivalent to --threads 5 -s 15 -w.
  -h, --help		Print this help message.
  --noreverse		Skip the reverse lookup operations.
  --nocolor		Disable ANSIColor output.
  --private		Show and save private ips at the end of the file domain_ips.txt.
  --subfile <file>	Write all valid subdomains to this file.
  -t, --timeout <value>	The tcp and udp timeout values in seconds (default: 10s).
  --threads <value>	The number of threads that will perform different queries.
  -v, --verbose		Be verbose: show all the progress and all the error messages.
GOOGLE SCRAPING OPTIONS:
  -p, --pages <value>	The number of google search pages to process when scraping names, 
			the default is 5 pages, the -s switch must be specified.
  -s, --scrap <value>	The maximum number of subdomains that will be scraped from Google (default 15).
BRUTE FORCE OPTIONS:
  -f, --file <file>	Read subdomains from this file to perform brute force.
  -u, --update	<a|g|r|z>
			Update the file specified with the -f switch with valid subdomains.
	a (all)		Update using all results.
	g		Update using only google scraping results.
	r		Update using only reverse lookup results.
	z		Update using only zonetransfer results.
  -r, --recursion	Recursion on subdomains, brute force all discovred subdomains that have an NS record.
WHOIS NETRANGE OPTIONS:
  -d, --delay <value>	The maximum value of seconds to wait between whois queries, the value is defined randomly, default: 3s.
  -w, --whois		Perform the whois queries on c class network ranges.
			 **Warning**: this can generate very large netranges and it will take lot of time to performe reverse lookups.
REVERSE LOOKUP OPTIONS:
  -e, --exclude	<regexp>
			Exclude PTR records that match the regexp expression from reverse lookup results, useful on invalid hostnames.
OUTPUT OPTIONS:
  -o --output <file>	Output in XML format. Can be imported in MagicTree (www.gremwell.com)
